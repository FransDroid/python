# Emotion Detection and Image Classification using Supervised Learning

This Python project aims to detect emotions in images through supervised learning techniques. It utilizes deep learning models for image classification and emotion recognition. By leveraging pre-trained models and custom datasets, this project facilitates understanding and recognition of emotions portrayed in images.

## Features:
- **Emotion Detection:** Detects and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., depicted in images.
- **Image Classification:** Utilizes supervised learning techniques to classify images based on predefined labels.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to incorporate new emotion categories or image classes.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for efficient and accurate emotion recognition and image classification.

## Sample Data:
Sample dataset included in this repository consists of images categorized into various emotion classes, such as:
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Surprised
- Neutral

The dataset is organized into separate folders for each emotion class, ensuring ease of use for training and testing purposes.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
